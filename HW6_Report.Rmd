```

## Question 2a 
A graph showing the IQ levels by location status

```{r}
lead_data <- read.csv("DataRaw/lead-iq-01.csv")
lead_near <- subset(lead_data, lead_data$Smelter == "Near")
lead_far <- subset(lead_data, lead_data$Smelter == "Far")

boxplot(lead_near$IQ, lead_far$IQ, col = c("orange", "brown"), main = "IQ Level for Near and Far from Smelter", xlab = "Smelter Distance", ylab = "IQ", names = c("Near", "Far"), ylim = c(0, 150))
  #Y limits set because the far data has an extreme outlier that makes the graphs hard to read
```

## Question 2b
At least one nicely formatted table (hint, try the 'kable' function in the knitr R package)
```{r}
library(knitr)
#?knitr
kable(lead_data[c(1:5,68:72), ], col.names = c("Index", "Smelter", "IQ"), padding = 4)
  #Indexes chosen as first 5 values for each smelter distance status 
```
