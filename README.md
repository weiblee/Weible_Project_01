<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

To create this readme.md, start in the R console in a project (can initialize it
as a git repository) and then use: 
  library(devtools)
  use_readme_md()
  
The goal of Weible_Project_01 is to complete the HW6 assignment for BIOS 6621 
(Statistical Consulting) to learn how to use git. There are 5 subdirectories 
(Background, Code, Reports, DataProcessed, and DataRaw). Background will contain background information, Code will contain the code in
Rmd, Reports will contain the kitted reports, DataProcessed will contain any 
adjusted data, and DataRaw will contain the raw data and will not be changed.
